## 1. Origin

The Garnet project originated from a single question posed during personal research on April 11, 2026: given the industry's simultaneous investment in Rust (for systems-level safety guarantees) and Ruby (for developer expressiveness), is there a principled way to unify both paradigms within a single language — not as a meta-language or preprocessor, but as first-class, compiler-enforced modes within one coherent grammar?

Before any implementation began, the author conducted a structured multi-model research sequence involving five frontier AI systems (Claude, GPT, Grok, Gemini, and back to Claude for synthesis) across seven analytical passes to establish: (a) the novelty of the dual-mode approach, (b) the feasibility of the proposed memory primitive system, (c) the gap in existing language design literature, and (d) the minimum viable specification required for a working prototype. All models were instructed to evaluate the proposal at MIT-level rigor.

## 2. Architecture

Garnet introduces a dual-mode programming model:

- **Managed mode (`def`)**: Reference-counted memory, dynamic-ish type feel, Ruby-like surface syntax, optimized for developer velocity in orchestration code.
- **Safe mode (`@safe fn`)**: Ownership-based memory with a move-tracking borrow checker, static type enforcement, zero-cost abstractions, optimized for performance-critical hot paths.
- **Mode boundary**: A first-class compiler construct that auto-bridges between modes, audits crossings, and preserves velocity where safety is unnecessary while enforcing correctness where it matters.
- **First-class memory primitives**: Four declarative memory types (working, episodic, semantic, procedural) as language-level constructs, not library imports.
- **Typed actors**: Compiler-enforced message protocols for concurrent agent systems.
- **Capability annotations (`@caps`)**: Compile-time authority verification — no ambient authority.

## 4. Novel Contributions (Pre-Registered Findings)

Paper VI (Empirical Validation) reports seven pre-registered contributions across Phase 1C (registered) and Phase 4A (executed):

- **4 supported**: Dual-mode design, mode boundary as first-class construct, compiler-as-agent cache, actor hot-reload with state migration
- **2 partial**: Capability propagation across module boundaries, memory primitive R+R+I decay curves
- **0 refuted**
- **1 pending-infra**: Requires full compiler backend (LLVM) for performance benchmarking

## 5. Design Philosophy

Garnet's name derives from the gemstone — formed under pressure, compressed, hardened, and beautiful because of the force, not despite it. The design philosophy is reconciliation, not replacement:

- Rust's rigor without abandoning Ruby's readability
- Agent-native memory without requiring external infrastructure
- Compile-time safety without sacrificing developer velocity at the orchestration layer
- A language designed for the era of AI-assisted development, where agents write most code and humans read and verify it

## 6. Licensing

Garnet is dual-licensed under Apache License 2.0 and MIT License, matching Rust's own licensing model. Contributions are accepted under DCO 1.1.

## 7. Availability

- **Source code**: Pending public GitHub release (v0.1.0)
- **Website**: garnet-lang.org (registered, awaiting deployment)
- **Universal installer**: sh.garnet-lang.org (shellchecked, pending deployment)
- **Domain**: garnet-lang.org (registered by author)

## 8. Acknowledgments

This project was built by a single developer with no institutional affiliation or funding, using frontier AI systems as architectural collaborators during a constrained development window (April 11–17, 2026). The research validation sequence involved five AI systems providing independent analysis before implementation began.
