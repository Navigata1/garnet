// M4 — Enforced / Declared Legend (pure catalog + projection).
//
// The single source of truth for WHICH fences the runtime actually *enforces*,
// which are only *declared*, and which are platform-*deferred*. Ported verbatim
// from the Windows shell's catalog (apps/garnet-studio/src-tauri/src/commands.rs
// `enforcement_catalog`) so the two Studios make the SAME claim. The
// enforced-vs-declared boundary is a load-bearing claim surface: it is never
// widened here, and an "enforced" row reads as *confirmed live* ONLY when the
// live static-gate probe reproduced this run (see `EnforcementLegendCard`).
//
// Claim anchors (CLAUDE.md): enforced = @caps + @max_depth (both backends;
// seccomp Linux-only); @bounded / @mailbox / memory / time are declared-not-
// enforced; OS sandbox off Linux is deferred. Garnet is research-grade (v0.x).
