## 1. Scope

Garnet v1.0 specifies the complete surface syntax and normative semantics for:

1. Module declarations and imports
2. Memory unit declarations *(carried from v0.2 §2)*
3. Function definitions in both managed and safe modes
4. Expression and statement grammar including control flow
5. Error handling model (dual-mode)
6. `@safe` mode boundaries, crossing rules, **borrow checker, and lifetime inference** *(extended from v0.3 §8)*
7. Typed message protocols, actor declarations, and **Sendable-equivalent** *(extended from v0.3 §9)*
8. Recursive execution guardrails with concrete annotation syntax *(extended from v0.2 §5)*
9. Type system foundations including **monomorphization, `@dynamic` dispatch, and structural protocols** *(extended from v0.3 §11)*
10. Pattern matching
11. **REPL semantics** [v1.0 §15]
12. **Tooling ergonomics summary** [v1.0 §16, full spec in Paper VII]

**Out of v1.0 scope:** codegen IR (LLVM/Cranelift) layout, optimization passes, standard library contents, package manager protocol details, interop ABI layout. These belong to the Compiler Architecture Specification, Standard Library Outline, and Paper VII Implementation Ladder — not the language spec.

---

## 2. Lexical Grammar

### 2.1 Character set and encoding

Garnet source files MUST be valid UTF-8. The compiler MUST reject files containing invalid UTF-8 sequences before lexing begins. Line endings MUST be normalized to `\n` (LF); `\r\n` (CRLF) is accepted and silently converted.

### 2.2 Keywords

The following identifiers are reserved and MUST NOT be used as user-defined names:

**Mode and structure:**
`module` `use` `@safe` `@dynamic` `pub` `end`

**Declarations:**
`def` `fn` `let` `var` `const` `type` `trait` `impl` `struct` `enum` `protocol`

**Memory and actors:**
`memory` `working` `episodic` `semantic` `procedural` `actor` `on` `spawn` `send`

**Control flow:**
`if` `elsif` `else` `while` `for` `in` `loop` `break` `continue` `return` `match` `when` `yield` `next`

**Error handling:**
`try` `rescue` `ensure` `raise` `Result` `Ok` `Err`

**Ownership (safe mode):**
`own` `borrow` `mut` `ref` `move`

**Recursion guardrails:**
`@max_depth` `@fan_out` `@require_metadata`

**Sendable + dynamic dispatch [v1.0]:**
`@nonsendable` `Sendable` `dyn`

**Literals and values:**
`true` `false` `nil` `self` `super`

> **Why `protocol` is now a top-level keyword [v1.0]:** v0.3 introduced `protocol` only inside `actor` blocks (§9.1 actor-item). v1.0 §11.8 generalizes `protocol` to a structural-type declaration. The two uses are syntactically disambiguated by context: inside an `actor { ... }`, `protocol foo(...)` declares a typed message; outside, `protocol Foo { ... }` declares a duck-typed structural protocol. The keyword is shared because both meanings share the kernel idea of "a contract a participant must satisfy."

### 2.3 Operators and precedence

From lowest to highest binding:

| Precedence | Operators | Associativity | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `=` `+=` `-=` `*=` `/=` `%=` | Right | Assignment |
| 2 | `or` | Left | Logical OR |
| 3 | `and` | Left | Logical AND |
| 4 | `not` | Prefix | Logical NOT |
| 5 | `==` `!=` `<` `>` `<=` `>=` | Left | Comparison |
| 6 | `..` `...` | Left | Range (inclusive / exclusive) |
| 7 | `\|>` | Left | Pipeline |
| 8 | `+` `-` | Left | Addition / subtraction |
| 9 | `*` `/` `%` | Left | Multiplication / division / modulo |
| 10 | `-` `not` `!` | Prefix | Unary negation, logical not, bitwise not |
| 11 | `.` `::` `()` `[]` | Left | Member access, path, call, index |

**Design rationale (MIT-defensible):** The pipeline operator `|>` (borrowed from Elixir/F#/OCaml) is included because Garnet targets agent orchestration where data flows through transformation chains. It desugars to function application: `x |> f` becomes `f(x)`, `x |> f(y)` becomes `f(x, y)`. This provides fluent left-to-right reading of chains that would otherwise nest deeply.

### 2.4 Literals

```
integer    := [0-9]+ ("_" [0-9]+)*                    # 1_000_000
float      := integer "." integer ([eE] [+-]? integer)?
string     := '"' (char | "#{" expr "}")* '"'          # interpolated
raw_string := 'r"' char* '"'                           # no interpolation
symbol     := ":" ident                                # :ok, :error
boolean    := "true" | "false"
nil_lit    := "nil"
array      := "[" (expr ("," expr)*)? "]"
map        := "{" (expr "=>" expr ("," expr "=>" expr)*)? "}"
```

**String interpolation:** `#{}` inside double-quoted strings evaluates the enclosed expression, calls `.to_s` on the result, and splices the string representation in place. The parser MUST re-enter expression parsing for the interpolated segment. This is consistent with Ruby's interpolation and already implemented in the v0.2 parser's `expr.rs`.

---

## 3. Module System

### 3.1 File-based modules

Each `.garnet` file constitutes a module. The module name is derived from the filename by stripping the extension and converting to PascalCase. Directories create nested module paths:

```
src/
  main.garnet          # module Main (entry point)
  memory/
    core.garnet        # module Memory::Core
    manager.garnet     # module Memory::Manager
  agents/
    build_agent.garnet # module Agents::BuildAgent
```

### 3.2 Inline modules

```
module-decl := ("@safe")? ("pub")? "module" ident "{" item* "}"
```

A module MAY be declared inline within another module. Inline modules share the same file but create a distinct namespace. The `@safe` annotation, if present, MUST precede `module` and applies to all items within.

### 3.3 Imports

```
use-decl := "use" path ("::" "{" ident ("," ident)* "}")? 
          | "use" path "::" "*"
```

Examples:
```garnet
use Memory::Core                    # import module, access via Core::method
use Memory::Core::{Store, Index}    # import specific items
use Memory::Core::*                 # glob import (discouraged in safe mode)
```

### 3.4 Visibility

Items are private to their module by default. The `pub` keyword makes an item visible to importing modules. The `pub(module)` form restricts visibility to the parent module only.

**Design rationale:** Rust's visibility model is proven and well-understood. Privacy-by-default is essential for safe mode's ownership guarantees (external code cannot alias internal state). The four-model consensus point 2 (dual-mode as correct shape) requires that safe-mode visibility rules be strict while managed mode can be more permissive, but defaulting to private in both modes prevents accidental exposure.

---

## 4. Memory Units *(carried from v0.2 §2, unchanged through §4.4; §4.5 added in v1.0)*

### 4.1 Declaration form

```
memory-decl  := "memory" memory-kind ident ":" store-type
memory-kind  := "working" | "episodic" | "semantic" | "procedural"
store-type   := ident ("<" type-args ">")?
type-args    := type ("," type)*
type         := ident ("<" type-args ">")? | fn-type | tuple-type
fn-type      := "(" type-args? ")" "->" type
tuple-type   := "(" type "," type ("," type)* ")"
```

### 4.2 Semantics *(unchanged from v0.2 §2.2)*

A memory unit declaration MUST introduce a top-level binding whose static type is `store-type` and whose runtime identity is unique within the enclosing module. Two memory units of the same kind and ident in the same module MUST be a compile-time error. The four memory kinds are type-level tags, not independent types.

### 4.3 Out of scope *(unchanged from v0.2 §2.3)*

Retention policies, TTL semantics, ranking functions, privacy scopes, persistence guarantees, wire formats — all belong to the Memory Manager and Memory Core, not the language core. See `GARNET_Memory_Manager_Architecture.md` for the runtime-layer specification that addresses OQ-7 (R+R+I decay formula) and OQ-8 (multi-agent consistency).

### 4.4 Generics over memory kinds *(unchanged from v0.3 §4.4 — explicit deferral)*

Garnet v1.0 does NOT support parameterizing a function or type over a memory kind. A declaration such as `def foo<M: MemoryKind>(x: M) { ... }` is rejected by the parser. The deferral rationale from v0.3 §4.4 is preserved.

### 4.5 ARC cycle detection [v1.0 — addresses Phase 1B Swift gap #1]

Managed mode (§8.2) provides automatic reference counting (ARC) for all reference types. Naïve reference counting cannot reclaim cyclic structures (e.g., a parent owning a child that holds a back-reference to the parent). v1.0 specifies the cycle-detection algorithm normatively so that implementations agree on observable behavior, including drop ordering and `__finalize` timing.

#### 4.5.1 Algorithm: synchronous trial-deletion (Bacon–Rajan 2001) with kind-aware roots

The compiler MUST emit, and the runtime MUST execute, the following trial-deletion algorithm whenever ARC decrement triggers cycle scanning. The algorithm is taken verbatim from Bacon & Rajan's *Concurrent Cycle Collection in Reference Counted Systems* (ECOOP 2001), with one Garnet-specific extension noted below.

Each ARC-managed object carries three runtime tags:

- **color**: one of `Black` (in-use), `Gray` (probable cycle member), `White` (provisionally garbage), `Purple` (root candidate)
- **rc**: the unsigned reference count
- **buffered**: a boolean — has this object been added to the candidate roots buffer this cycle?

On every reference-count decrement that does NOT reach zero, the runtime MUST:

```
release(s):
    s.rc -= 1
    if s.rc == 0:
        free(s)                              # not a cycle candidate
    elif s.color != Purple:
        s.color = Purple                     # mark as candidate root
        if not s.buffered:
            s.buffered = true
            roots.push(s)                    # buffer for later scan
        if roots.len() >= scan_threshold:
            collect_cycles()
```

The `scan_threshold` is implementation-defined but MUST default to 256 buffered roots. An implementation MAY tune the threshold dynamically based on allocation pressure.

`collect_cycles` then runs three passes over the roots buffer:

```
collect_cycles():
    for each s in roots: mark_gray(s)
    for each s in roots: scan(s)
    for each s in roots: collect_white(s)
    roots.clear()

mark_gray(s):
    if s.color != Gray:
        s.color = Gray
        for each t in children(s):
            t.rc -= 1                        # speculative decrement
            mark_gray(t)

scan(s):
    if s.color == Gray:
        if s.rc > 0:
            scan_black(s)                    # not garbage — re-establish
        else:
            s.color = White
            for each t in children(s): scan(t)

scan_black(s):
    s.color = Black
    for each t in children(s):
        t.rc += 1                            # undo speculative decrement
        if t.color != Black: scan_black(t)

collect_white(s):
    if s.color == White and not s.buffered:
        s.color = Black
        for each t in children(s): collect_white(t)
        free(s)
```

#### 4.5.2 Garnet extension: kind-aware root partitioning

`children(s)` returns the ARC-managed children of `s` reachable through any field. v0.3 §4 introduced four memory kinds — `working`, `episodic`, `semantic`, `procedural`. v1.0 makes one Garnet-specific refinement to Bacon–Rajan: **roots are partitioned by memory kind**, and `collect_cycles` MAY scan one kind's root set without scanning the others.

This matters because the four kinds have different lifetime profiles:

| Kind | Typical lifetime | Cycle-scan frequency (default) |
|------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| working | request-scoped | every 64 buffered roots |
| episodic | session-scoped | every 256 buffered roots |
| semantic | process-lifetime | every 1024 buffered roots |
| procedural | persistent (rarely reclaimed) | scan only on explicit `gc.run()` |

Cross-kind cycles (e.g., a working-memory object pointing to an episodic-memory object pointing back) are detected when ANY of the involved kinds triggers a scan. The Bacon–Rajan algorithm's correctness is preserved because `mark_gray` and `scan` traverse `children(s)` without filtering by kind — the partitioning is purely a scheduling optimization.

#### 4.5.3 Finalization

When `free(s)` runs, if `s` defines a `def __finalize(self) { ... }` method, the runtime MUST invoke it before reclaiming memory. Finalizers MUST NOT resurrect their object (assign `self` to a new strong reference); attempting to do so produces undefined behavior in v1.0 and will be promoted to a runtime error in v1.1.

#### 4.5.4 Safe mode interaction

Safe-mode (`@safe`) modules MUST NOT use ARC-managed types except through the boundary rules of §8.4. Cycle detection consequently does NOT operate on safe-mode allocations; affine ownership (§8.3) precludes cyclic ownership at compile time, so no runtime check is required.

#### 4.5.5 Observable invariants (MIT-defensible)

> **ARC + Cycle Detection Soundness Theorem [v1.0]**
>
> For any managed-mode program P that terminates normally (no `panic`, no infinite loop):
>
> 1. **No leaks of cyclic garbage.** Every object unreachable from any root is reclaimed within `O(scan_threshold)` allocations.
> 2. **No premature reclamation.** No object reachable from any root is reclaimed.
> 3. **Finalizer determinism.** For any two objects `a`, `b` whose live-references graph forms an acyclic structure with `a → b`, `a.__finalize` is invoked strictly before `b.__finalize`.
>
> **Proof sketch.** Properties 1 and 2 follow directly from Bacon & Rajan (2001) §3.5–3.7, whose proof rests on the invariant that `mark_gray` + `scan_black` round-trip preserves the true reference count. Garnet's kind-aware extension (§4.5.2) does not affect correctness because partitioning only schedules when scans run, not what `mark_gray` traverses. Property 3 follows from the topological invariant of trial-deletion: `collect_white` recurses into children before freeing the parent.

**Why Bacon–Rajan over Swift's mainline ARC:** Swift relies on programmer-inserted `weak`/`unowned` annotations to break cycles; cycles without those annotations leak silently. This was acceptable for Swift's UIKit-centric origins but is the wrong default for agent systems where data graphs are dynamic and refactor-heavy. Bacon–Rajan adds bounded overhead (~5–8% in measured Cocoa retrofits per the original paper) for guaranteed-no-leak semantics. Paper III §3.1 cited "ARC can be predictable and serious" as Swift's contribution — v1.0 takes that contribution one step further by removing the cycle footgun while preserving the predictable-cost property.

## 5. Function Definitions

### 5.1 Managed-mode functions [v0.3]

```
managed-fn := ("pub")? "def" ident "(" param-list? ")" ("->" type)? block
param-list := param ("," param)*
param      := ident (":" type)?
block      := "{" stmt* expr? "}"
```

In managed mode, parameter types are OPTIONAL. When omitted, the compiler infers types from usage (gradual typing). The return type is OPTIONAL; when omitted, it is inferred from the body's final expression.

The last expression in a block is its implicit return value (Ruby convention). An explicit `return` MAY be used for early exits.

```garnet
# Managed mode — types optional, Ruby-like feel
def greet(name) {
  "Hello, #{name}!"
}

# With optional type annotations
def add(x: Int, y: Int) -> Int {
  x + y
}
```

**Design rationale (MIT-defensible):** The block syntax uses `{ }` (braces) rather than `end` keywords. This decision was forced by the v0.2 parser, which already uses braces for actor bodies, handler blocks, and the provisional expression grammar. Consistency across all block-delimited constructs prevents the confusing dual-delimiters problem that plagued Lua and early Kotlin. The `def` keyword signals "managed-mode function" and serves as a semantic beacon for both humans and LLMs — aligning with Frontier 1 (LLM-Native Compilation) from the gap analysis. The implicit last-expression return preserves Ruby's expressive philosophy (consensus point 2: dual-mode is correct).

### 5.2 Safe-mode functions [v0.3]

```
safe-fn    := ("pub")? "fn" ident "(" typed-params? ")" "->" type block
typed-params := typed-param ("," typed-param)*
typed-param  := (ownership)? ident ":" type
ownership    := "own" | "borrow" | "ref" | "mut"
```

In safe mode, ALL parameter types and the return type are REQUIRED. Ownership annotations are available on parameters: `own` transfers ownership into the function, `borrow` takes a shared reference, `mut` takes a mutable reference, `ref` is a read-only reference (alias for `borrow`).

```garnet
@safe
module FastPath {
  # Safe mode — types required, ownership explicit
  fn process(own data: Buffer, borrow config: Config) -> Buffer {
    let ref header = data.slice(0, 4)
    let mut body = data.slice(4, -1)
    body.transform()
    data
  }
}
```

**Design rationale:** The `fn` keyword signals "safe-mode function" — a distinct keyword from `def` that immediately tells both the developer and the compiler which mode's rules apply. Ownership annotations on parameters make the borrow checker's expectations visible at the call site, addressing Rust's most-cited usability complaint (hidden ownership transfer). The four-model consensus point 2 mandates that safe mode provides Rust-level guarantees; explicit ownership annotations are the mechanism.

### 5.3 Closures (both modes) [v0.3]

```
closure := "|" param-list? "|" ("->" type)? block
         | "|" param-list? "|" expr
```

```garnet
# Short form — single expression
let double = |x| x * 2

# Block form
let transform = |data: Buffer| -> Buffer {
  let processed = data.compress()
  processed.validate()
  processed
}

# In pipelines
items |> map(|x| x.name) |> filter(|n| n.starts_with("G"))
```

In managed mode, closures capture variables by reference (ARC increment). In safe mode, closures follow Rust-style capture rules: by reference when borrowing, by value when moving. The `move` keyword forces value capture: `move |x| { ... }`.

### 5.4 Blocks and `yield` [v1.0 — addresses Phase 1B Ruby gap #8]

In addition to the explicit closure form (§5.3), managed-mode functions MAY accept an *implicit block parameter* — a closure attached at the call site without appearing in the parameter list. This preserves Ruby's idiomatic block-passing style for iterators, DSLs, and resource-acquisition patterns.

#### 5.4.1 Grammar

```
block-arg     := do-block | brace-block
do-block      := "do" ("|" param-list? "|")? stmt* expr? "end"
brace-block   := "{" ("|" param-list? "|")? stmt* expr? "}"
yield-expr    := "yield" ("(" arg-list? ")")?
next-expr     := "next" expr?
```

A function call MAY be followed by a `do…end` or `{…}` block. The block becomes the call's implicit block argument:

```garnet
def each_line(text) {
  for line in text.split("\n") {
    yield(line)             # invokes the block
  }
}

each_line(file.read()) do |line|
  log("got: #{line}")
end

# Brace form preferred for one-liners
each_line(file.read()) { |line| log(line) }
```

`yield` is normatively defined as "invoke the implicit block parameter of the lexically enclosing `def`."

#### 5.4.2 Block binding rules (formal)

Let *B* be a block syntactically attached to a call to function *f*, defined in lexical scope *S*. Let *f*'s body contain `yield(args)`. Then:

- *B* captures all bindings from *S* by reference (managed-mode semantics, §5.3).
- `yield(args)` evaluates *args* in *f*'s scope, then invokes *B* with those arguments bound to *B*'s parameters. *B* executes with read/write access to its captured bindings in *S*.
- The value of `yield(args)` is the value of *B*'s last expression (or the value passed to `next` — see §5.4.3).
- If *f* has no implicit block at the call site and `yield` is reached, the runtime MUST raise `LocalJumpError`.

#### 5.4.3 Block return rules (formal — the most subtle point)

The Mini-Spec specifies block control-flow with the same semantics as Ruby, because programmers familiar with blocks expect this and the alternative semantics (closure-style) make `each` patterns surprising.

| Statement | Effect inside a block |
|-----------|----------------------|
| `next expr` | Returns `expr` from the block to the enclosing `yield`. Equivalent to a closure's return-from-call. |
| `break expr` | Returns `expr` from the call to *f* itself, as if *f* had executed `return expr`. |
| `return expr` | Returns `expr` from the *def lexically enclosing the block-bearing call*, NOT from the block and NOT from *f*. |

Example demonstrating all three:

```garnet
def find_first_match(items) {
  items.each do |item|
    if item.matches?(query) {
      return item            # returns from find_first_match, not from .each
    }
    if item.skip? {
      next nil               # returns nil to the .each iterator; loop continues
    }
    if item.fatal? {
      break nil              # returns nil from .each itself; iteration ends
    }
  end
  nil
}
```

This matches Ruby's documented semantics (Pickaxe §4.4 "Blocks, Closures, and Procs"). The rationale for `return` escaping the *enclosing def* is that blocks are conceptually "syntactic continuations of the caller" rather than independent functions.

#### 5.4.4 Procs and lambdas (deferred to v1.1)

Ruby distinguishes blocks (the implicit argument), `Proc.new { … }` (block-like return semantics), and `->(x) { … }` (lambda — `return` returns from the lambda itself). v1.0 specifies only blocks and the explicit closure form (§5.3). The `Proc.new` constructor and `->` arrow lambda are explicitly DEFERRED to v1.1; programmers who need closure-return semantics should use the §5.3 `|x| { … }` form, which behaves like a Ruby lambda.

#### 5.4.5 Safe-mode prohibition

Implicit blocks are MANAGED-MODE ONLY. A `@safe` module MUST reject `do…end`, `{…}` block-arguments, and `yield` expressions; safe code must use the explicit closure form (§5.3) so that ownership transfer is visible at the call site.

**Design rationale (MIT-defensible):** The Ruby block / yield pattern is the single most-cited reason developers pick Ruby for DSLs, iterators, and resource acquisition (`File.open(path) do |f| … end`). Garnet's managed mode would feel foreign to Ruby developers without it. Adopting Ruby's exact return-semantics (rather than reinterpreting them) means thirty years of accumulated Ruby idioms transfer directly. The cost is the well-known surprise that `return` inside a block escapes the enclosing method — but this is documented prominently and consistent with what Ruby developers already expect.

---

## 6. Statements and Control Flow [v0.3]

### 6.1 Variable declarations

```
let-decl   := "let" ("mut")? ident (":" type)? "=" expr
var-decl   := "var" ident (":" type)? "=" expr        # managed mode only
const-decl := "const" ident (":" type)? "=" expr
```

`let` declares an immutable binding (both modes). `let mut` declares a mutable binding (both modes). `var` is managed-mode sugar for `let mut` — provided because scripting-oriented developers expect mutable-by-default variables to have a short keyword. A `@safe` module MUST reject `var` declarations; use `let mut` instead. `const` declares a compile-time constant.

### 6.2 Control flow

```
if-expr     := "if" expr block ("elsif" expr block)* ("else" block)?
while-stmt  := "while" expr block
for-stmt    := "for" ident "in" expr block
loop-stmt   := "loop" block                    # infinite loop, break to exit
break-stmt  := "break" expr?
continue-stmt := "continue"
return-stmt := "return" expr?
```

`if` is an EXPRESSION, not a statement — it returns a value:
```garnet
let status = if score > 90 { :excellent } elsif score > 70 { :good } else { :needs_work }
```

**Design rationale:** `if`-as-expression eliminates the ternary operator and aligns with Rust and Kotlin. `elsif` (not `else if`) is a single keyword — consistent with Ruby, easier to lex, and unambiguous in the grammar. `loop` with explicit `break` replaces `while true` patterns and makes infinite loops intentional (same rationale as Rust). No `unless` — it adds cognitive load without expressive power (Crystal dropped it from its Ruby inheritance for the same reason).

### 6.3 Pattern matching [v0.3]

```
match-expr := "match" expr "{" match-arm ("," match-arm)* "}"
match-arm  := pattern ("if" expr)? "=>" (expr | block)
pattern    := literal-pattern | ident-pattern | tuple-pattern
            | enum-pattern | wildcard | rest-pattern
literal-pattern := integer | float | string | symbol | "true" | "false" | "nil"
ident-pattern   := ident
tuple-pattern   := "(" pattern ("," pattern)* ")"
enum-pattern    := path "(" pattern ("," pattern)* ")"
wildcard        := "_"
rest-pattern    := ".."
```

```garnet
match result {
  Ok(value) => process(value),
  Err(:not_found) => default_value(),
  Err(e) if e.retryable? => retry(operation),
  Err(e) => raise e,
}
```

In safe mode, pattern matching MUST be exhaustive — the compiler MUST reject a `match` expression that does not cover all variants. In managed mode, non-exhaustive matches are permitted but emit a compiler warning; an unmatched value at runtime raises `MatchError`.

**Design rationale (MIT-defensible):** Pattern matching is now established as essential in modern language design (Rust, Swift, Kotlin, Python 3.10+, Java 21). Garnet's match combines Rust's algebraic-type exhaustiveness guarantees with Ruby's guard-clause expressiveness (`if` guards on arms). The `=>` arrow syntax follows Rust/Scala convention, which is the most widely recognized among systems-and-web developers. Symbols (`:not_found`) provide lightweight domain-specific tags without requiring full enum declarations — critical for the scripting use case (consensus point 2: managed mode must feel Ruby-like).

## 7. Error Handling (Dual-Mode) [v0.3]

### 7.1 Design principle

Error handling is the most architecturally significant consequence of the dual-mode design. Managed mode uses exception-style error handling for developer ergonomics. Safe mode uses `Result<T,E>` for compile-time error exhaustiveness. The mode boundary performs automatic bridging.

**This is a novel contribution.** No existing production language provides automatic bidirectional error-model bridging across a type-system mode boundary. TypeScript has no mode boundary. Rust has no exceptions. Swift has exceptions but no mode boundary. Garnet is the first to formalize this.

> **Implementation note [v1.0].** The "automatic" bridging described in this section is the v4.0 target. v3.2/v3.3 implements the bridging contract via user-authored try/rescue + ? at boundaries — see Paper VI §C5 for the explicit distinction between v3.2's shipped behavior and v4.0's automatic compiler-inserted wrappers. The grammar and semantics here describe the v4.0 surface; conforming v0.x implementations MAY require explicit bridging wrappers as long as the diagnostics direct programmers to write the correct manual form.

### 7.2 Managed-mode error handling

```
try-expr := "try" block rescue-clause+ ensure-clause?
rescue-clause := "rescue" (ident (":" type)?)? block
ensure-clause := "ensure" block
raise-stmt := "raise" expr
```

```garnet
# Managed mode — exceptions for ergonomic error handling
def fetch_data(url) {
  try {
    let response = Http.get(url)
    response.parse_json()
  } rescue e: NetworkError {
    log("Network failed: #{e.message}")
    cached_data(url)
  } rescue e {
    raise e  # re-raise unknown errors
  } ensure {
    connection.close()
  }
}
```

Managed-mode code MAY raise any value as an exception. `try`/`rescue` catches exceptions by type. `ensure` always executes (equivalent to Java's `finally`, Ruby's `ensure`). Uncaught exceptions propagate up the call stack.

### 7.3 Safe-mode error handling

```garnet
@safe
module Storage {
  enum StorageError {
    NotFound(String),
    Corruption(String),
    Io(IoError),
  }

  fn read_block(own handle: FileHandle, offset: u64) -> Result<Block, StorageError> {
    let header = handle.read_at(offset)?    # ? propagates Err
    if header.magic != BLOCK_MAGIC {
      return Err(StorageError::Corruption("bad magic"))
    }
    let data = handle.read_at(offset + HEADER_SIZE)?
    Ok(Block::new(header, data))
  }
}
```

Safe-mode functions MUST use `Result<T, E>` for fallible operations. The `?` operator propagates `Err` values to the caller. Safe-mode code MUST NOT use `raise` or `try`/`rescue`; the compiler MUST reject these constructs in `@safe` modules.

### 7.4 Boundary bridging [v0.3]

When managed code calls a safe function returning `Result<T,E>`:
- `Ok(value)` is unwrapped and returned as the bare value
- `Err(error)` is automatically raised as an exception of type `SafeModeError(error)`

When safe code calls a managed function:
- The call is implicitly wrapped in a `try`/`rescue`
- Normal returns become `Ok(value)`
- Exceptions become `Err(ManagedError(exception))`

```garnet
# Managed code calling safe code — bridging is automatic (v4.0; manual via try/rescue in v3.x)
def process_file(path) {
  # Storage.read_block returns Result<Block, StorageError>
  # In managed mode, Err becomes an exception automatically
  let block = Storage.read_block(open(path), 0)  # may raise SafeModeError
  block.data
}
```

**Design rationale (MIT-defensible):** The error-bridging mechanism is formally justified by the mode-boundary calculus in Paper V §4. The managed-to-safe direction (unwrap + raise) preserves the managed-mode invariant that errors are exceptions. The safe-to-managed direction (wrap in try) preserves the safe-mode invariant that errors are values. Neither direction loses information — the original error is preserved inside the wrapper type. This is analogous to how Swift's Objective-C interop bridges NSError to Swift errors, but generalized to a formal dual-mode boundary. The four-model consensus point 2 (dual-mode is correct) implies that each mode's error model should be native to that mode, not a compromise — and the bridging mechanism makes this possible.

---

## 8. Mode Boundaries *(extended from v0.3 §8; §§8.5 and 8.6 added in v1.0)*

### 8.1 Formal grounding *(unchanged from v0.3 §8.1)*

Garnet's `@safe` mode is grounded in **affine type theory** (resources used at most once), formally verified by **RustBelt (Jung et al., POPL 2018, MPI-SWS)** using the **Iris framework** in Coq. See Paper V §2-§6 for the full formal treatment.

**Security Theorem (safe-mode soundness) [v0.3]:**

> For any `@safe` module M that type-checks under the Garnet v1.0 rules, the following properties hold:
>
> 1. **No use-after-free.** Dropped values are not subsequently accessible.
> 2. **No double-free.** Each owned value is dropped exactly once along every execution path.
> 3. **No data races.** Concurrent access to shared memory follows aliasing-XOR-mutation strictly.
> 4. **No memory unsafety** within the well-typed fragment (excluding explicit `extern "C"` boundaries, which are programmer-asserted unsafe by definition).
>
> **Proof sketch.** The λ_safe calculus (Paper V §3) inherits progress and preservation from RustBelt (Jung et al., POPL 2018). Garnet's module-granularity (rather than crate-granularity) refinement does not invalidate the core argument: the Iris separation-logic model of λ_safe is a sub-model of RustBelt's crate model, so any property proven for RustBelt lifts. Formal mechanization in Coq is planned for a future Paper V revision (18–30 person-months per the v2.4 handoff estimate).

This theorem statement elevates the earlier prose to a load-bearing normative claim that MIT or PLDI reviewers can scrutinize precisely.

### 8.2 Managed mode *(unchanged from v0.3 §8.2; cycle-collection algorithm specified in §4.5 v1.0)*

Managed mode MUST provide automatic reference counting with cycle detection. Values MAY be mutated without ownership discipline. Managed mode is the default. The cycle-detection algorithm is specified normatively in §4.5.

### 8.3 Safe mode [v0.3 — concrete syntax added]

A module MAY be annotated `@safe` by placing the annotation before the `module` keyword (inline modules) or as the first non-comment token in a `.garnet` file (file-based modules).

```garnet
# File: src/crypto/hasher.garnet
@safe  # This entire file is a safe-mode module

fn hash(own data: Bytes) -> Hash {
  let mut state = State::new()
  state.update(borrow data)
  state.finalize()
}
```

```garnet
# Inline safe module within a managed file
module App {
  @safe module Crypto {
    fn hash(own data: Bytes) -> Hash { ... }
  }

  def process(input) {
    Crypto.hash(input)  # managed calling safe — boundary bridging applies
  }
}
```

A `@safe` module MUST enforce (unchanged from v0.2 §3.3):
1. Single-owner (affine) semantics for all values
2. Aliasing-XOR-mutation for all references (formalized in §8.6)
3. Lexical or non-lexical lifetime inference (algorithm in §8.5)
4. No implicit allocation on hot paths

### 8.4 Boundary rules *(unchanged from v0.2 §3.4, plus error bridging from §7.4)*

1. Managed callers invoking `@safe` functions MUST satisfy ownership preconditions at call sites
2. `@safe` returns to managed mode MUST return either an owned value (adopted into ARC) or a borrowed reference with a statically proven lifetime
3. Managed memory units MAY be read from safe mode under shared borrow, but MUST NOT be mutated except through a formal bridging API *(reserved for v0.4)*
4. [v0.3] Error bridging follows §7.4 rules automatically at every mode-crossing call site
5. [v1.0] At the boundary, a managed-mode value passed to a safe-mode `borrow` parameter MUST have a lifetime ≥ the call's static frame; the compiler MAY insert a "freeze" check that pins the ARC count for the call's duration

### 8.5 Lifetime inference algorithm [v1.0 — addresses Phase 1B Rust gap #4]

Safe-mode references carry lifetimes — symbolic regions denoting the program-point span during which the reference is valid. v0.3 §8.3 required "lexical or non-lexical lifetime inference" without specifying the algorithm. v1.0 specifies the algorithm normatively, modeled on **Non-Lexical Lifetimes (NLL)** as defined by Rust RFC 2094 (Matsakis 2018).

#### 8.5.1 Algorithm overview

The compiler MUST translate each `@safe` function body to a Mid-level IR (MIR) — a control-flow graph (CFG) of basic blocks containing typed three-address operations. Lifetime inference proceeds in five stages:

1. **Build CFG.** Nodes are basic blocks; edges are control-flow successors.
2. **Compute liveness.** A reference is *live* at a program point P if its referent is read or written along some path from P. Liveness is computed by standard backward dataflow analysis.
3. **Generate region constraints.** For each reference assignment `r = &x` (or `&mut x`), introduce a region variable `'r`. For every program point P where `r` is live, add the constraint `'r ⊇ {P}`. For every reborrow `r2 = r` where `r2: &'b T` and `r: &'a T`, add `'a ⊇ 'b`.
4. **Solve constraints.** Compute the smallest `'r` satisfying all constraints (least fixed point). Existing solver: standard worklist algorithm, O(n·d) where n = nodes, d = max dataflow depth.
5. **Validate.** For each `&mut x` borrow at point P, check no other `&x` or `&mut x` is live at P. If violated, emit a borrow-checker error (§8.6).

#### 8.5.2 Lifetime elision rules

In safe-mode function signatures, lifetimes MAY be elided when they follow these *elision rules* (matching Rust's elision rules for backward compatibility):

1. **Each elided input lifetime becomes its own distinct lifetime parameter.** `fn f(x: borrow A, y: borrow B)` → `fn f<'a, 'b>(x: &'a A, y: &'b B)`.
2. **If there is exactly one elided input lifetime, it is assigned to all elided output lifetimes.** `fn f(x: borrow A) -> borrow B` → `fn f<'a>(x: &'a A) -> &'a B`.
3. **If there is a `borrow self` or `mut self` parameter, the lifetime of `self` is assigned to all elided output lifetimes.** `fn method(borrow self, x: borrow A) -> borrow B` → `fn method<'a, 'b>(self: &'a Self, x: &'b A) -> &'a B`.
4. **If none of the above apply, lifetimes MUST be written explicitly.** The compiler MUST emit `error E0106: missing lifetime specifier` with a suggestion.

#### 8.5.3 Variance

Lifetimes interact with type parameters through variance. v1.0 adopts Rust's variance rules:

| Position | Variance |
|----------|---------|
| `&'a T` (shared reference) | covariant in `'a` |
| `&'a mut T` (mutable reference) | invariant in `'a` AND in `T` |
| `fn(&'a T) -> ()` | contravariant in `'a` |
| `fn() -> &'a T` | covariant in `'a` |
| `Cell<T>`, `RefCell<T>` | invariant in `T` (interior mutability) |
| `T` in `struct S<T>` | inferred from how `T` is used in fields |

Rationale for invariance of `&'a mut T`: a mutable reference allows both reading and writing through it. Reading is covariant; writing is contravariant; the only way to satisfy both is invariance.

#### 8.5.4 Closures and lifetime inference

Closures in safe mode (per §5.3) capture by-reference by default. The compiler MUST infer the lifetime of each capture as the smallest region containing all uses of the closure. If a closure outlives any capture, the compiler MUST reject with `error E0373: closure may outlive captured variable`. The fix is either to extend the captured value's lifetime or to use `move |…| { … }` to transfer ownership into the closure.

#### 8.5.5 Higher-rank trait bounds (deferred)

`for<'a> Fn(&'a T)` higher-rank bounds (HRTB) are common in Rust for callback signatures. v1.0 explicitly DEFERS HRTB to v1.1; v1.0 type-checker may treat them as parse errors with a suggestion to use a concrete lifetime. Real impact on user code is minor because most callback signatures fall under elision rules 1–3.

#### 8.5.6 Interaction with managed mode

Managed-mode functions (called from safe mode via §8.4) erase lifetimes — the ARC system manages object lifetime independently. The boundary rule of §8.4 #5 (the "freeze" check) ensures that an ARC object passed by `borrow` lives at least as long as the safe-mode frame consuming it.

#### 8.5.7 Implementation status

v0.3 implementation: lifetimes parsed but NOT enforced. Safe-mode functions accept and parse lifetime annotations but the tree-walk interpreter does not run NLL inference; safe mode is currently checked at lower fidelity (single-owner enforced; aliasing-XOR-mutation enforced; lifetime correctness NOT proven). Full NLL inference is a Rung 4 deliverable (per §13). **Soundness during the gap window** is preserved by §8.4 #5 (ARC freeze) at boundaries and by §10 recursive guardrails: until NLL ships, programs with potentially-unsound lifetime patterns will leak instead of UB.

---

### 8.6 Borrow checker rules [v1.0 — addresses Phase 1B Rust gap #6]

Safe-mode borrow checking enforces aliasing-XOR-mutation across the program. v0.3 stated the rule informally; v1.0 specifies it as a checking algorithm operating on the MIR + region results from §8.5.

#### 8.6.1 Foundational rules

For every program point P and every memory location L:

- **Rule B1 (uniqueness of mutation).** At most ONE of the following sets may be non-empty at P:
  - the set of live shared borrows of L (`&L`)
  - the set of live mutable borrows of L (`&mut L`)
- **Rule B2 (mut implies unique).** A live `&mut L` at P forbids ANY other live borrow of L (or a sub-place of L) at P, including additional mutable borrows.
- **Rule B3 (lifetime containment).** If `r: &'a L` is live at P, then `'a ⊇ {P}` (the lifetime must cover the program point).
- **Rule B4 (no use after move).** If L is moved at point M, no read or write of L is permitted at any point reachable from M without an intervening reassignment.
- **Rule B5 (drop discipline).** When an owned value goes out of scope, its destructor (if any) runs. After drop, the location is uninitialized; B4 applies.

#### 8.6.2 Two-phase borrows (per Rust RFC 2025)

Self-referential method calls of the form `vec.push(vec.len())` would naively conflict (the call needs `&mut vec`, the argument needs `&vec`). v1.0 adopts Rust RFC 2025's *two-phase borrow* refinement:

A borrow created at `&mut e` MAY be split into a *reservation phase* (acts as `&e`, allows other shared borrows) and an *activation phase* (acts as `&mut e`, exclusive). Activation occurs at the first use of the mutable reference. Between reservation and activation, additional shared borrows of `e` are permitted IF none of them outlive the activation point.

This permits the natural `vec.push(vec.len())` pattern while preserving B1–B5 globally.

#### 8.6.3 Place algebra (sub-place tracking)

A place is a location expression like `x`, `x.f`, `x[i]`, `*x`. The borrow checker tracks borrows at *place granularity*: borrowing `x.f` does not preclude borrowing `x.g`, but DOES preclude borrowing `x` (because `x` is a super-place of `x.f`).

Place compatibility is computed by *prefix relation*: `p` and `q` conflict iff one is a prefix of the other. `x.f` is a prefix of `x.f.g`; `x[i]` and `x[j]` are conservatively treated as conflicting because `i = j` is undecidable in general.

#### 8.6.4 Diagnostic guarantees

When borrow check fails, the compiler MUST produce a diagnostic that:

1. Names the conflicting borrows (location, span, kind: `&`/`&mut`/`move`).
2. Identifies the program point of conflict.
3. Suggests a fix: scope reduction (move one borrow earlier/later), use of `clone()` to break the borrow, or refactoring with `RefCell<T>` (managed-mode escape hatch).

Match Rust's diagnostic quality for the same error class — diagnostics are first-class deliverables, not afterthoughts.

#### 8.6.5 Worked example

```garnet
@safe
fn rotate(mut buf: Buffer) -> Buffer {
  let ref a = buf.left()       # borrow check: &buf — OK
  let ref b = buf.right()      # borrow check: &buf — OK (B1: shared+shared compatible)
  buf.swap_halves(a, b)        # borrow check: &mut buf required, but a, b still live → ERROR
                                # (B2 violated: cannot &mut while shared borrows live)
  buf
}
```

The diagnostic should explain: "cannot borrow `buf` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable here (let ref a = …) and here (let ref b = …)." Suggested fix: read a and b into owned values first, then perform the mutable operation.

#### 8.6.6 Soundness

Together with §8.5 lifetime inference, §8.6 implements the safe-mode soundness theorem (§8.1). The proof connection: B1–B3 enforce the affine + aliasing-XOR-mutation discipline that RustBelt's Iris model proves sound. B4 + B5 enforce the use-once / drop-once discipline that prevents use-after-free and double-free.

---

## 9. Typed Message Protocols *(extended from v0.3 §9; §9.4 added in v1.0)*

### 9.1 Grammar [v0.3 — block now formally defined]

```
actor-decl    := ("pub")? "actor" ident "{" actor-item* "}"
actor-item    := actor-protocol-decl | handler-decl | memory-decl | let-decl
actor-protocol-decl := "protocol" ident "(" typed-params ")" ("->" type)?
handler-decl  := "on" ident "(" param-list ")" block
```

> **Naming clarification [v1.0].** Inside an `actor { … }` block, `protocol` declares a *typed message contract* (a single message name + its parameter types). Outside an actor block (top-level), `protocol` declares a *structural protocol* (§11.8 — a duck-typed contract). The parser disambiguates by syntactic position. The same keyword captures the underlying conceptual unity: both meanings are "a contract a participant must satisfy," but at different layers.

The `block` production is now the same as §5.1's block: `"{" stmt* expr? "}"`. This retires the provisional block grammar from the v0.2 parser's `expr.rs`.

### 9.2 Semantics *(unchanged from v0.2 §4.2; Sendable-equivalent added in §9.4)*

Actors MUST NOT share mutable state. All inter-actor communication MUST go through declared protocols. Undeclared protocol sends MUST be compile-time errors. Every declared protocol MUST have a handler. Type erasure and gradual typing are prohibited across actor boundaries even in managed mode.

**Protocol versioning (OQ-5, explicit deferral to v0.4).** v1.0 does not specify how protocol definitions evolve across a running distributed system. A v0.4 proposal will introduce a `@protocol_version` annotation with additive-evolution semantics analogous to Protobuf field tagging.

### 9.3 Actor state and memory [v0.3]

Actors MAY declare internal memory units and `let` bindings within their body. These are private to the actor instance and MUST NOT be accessible from outside. Memory units declared inside an actor are scoped to that actor's lifetime — they are created when the actor spawns and dropped when the actor terminates.

```garnet
actor BuildAgent {
  memory episodic   log     : EpisodeStore<BuildEvent>
  memory procedural recipes : WorkflowStore<BuildRecipe>
  let mut build_count = 0

  protocol build(spec: BuildSpec) -> BuildResult
  protocol status() -> AgentStatus

  on build(spec) {
    build_count += 1
    let recipe = recipes.find(spec.target)
    let result = recipe.execute(spec)
    log.append(BuildEvent::new(spec, result))
    result
  }

  on status() {
    AgentStatus::new(build_count, log.recent(10))
  }
}
```

### 9.4 Sendable-equivalent: cross-actor type discipline [v1.0 — addresses Phase 1B Swift gap #2]

To preserve actor isolation under typed message passing (§9.2), every value crossing an actor boundary MUST satisfy a static *Sendable* discipline. v1.0 introduces the `Sendable` marker trait — a Garnet adaptation of Swift's `Sendable` protocol (Swift Evolution SE-0302) calibrated to Garnet's dual-mode design.

#### 9.4.1 The `Sendable` marker trait

```garnet
trait Sendable { }                  # marker trait — no methods
```

A type implements `Sendable` if values of that type can be safely transmitted from one actor to another without introducing data races. Implementation is *automatic* for many types but MAY be opted out via `@nonsendable`.

#### 9.4.2 Auto-derive rules

The compiler MUST auto-derive `impl Sendable for T` if T satisfies all of:

1. **All fields are Sendable.** A struct/enum with all-Sendable fields auto-derives Sendable.
2. **No interior mutability.** T does not contain `Cell<U>`, `RefCell<U>`, `Mutex<U>`, or any type marked `@nonsendable`.
3. **In managed mode:** T is *frozen* — its fields are declared with `let` (immutable) and not `var` / `let mut`.
4. **In safe mode:** T is either owned (`own`-receivable) or behind an immutable shared reference (`&T`).

Built-in Sendable types: all primitive numerics (`Int`, `Float`, `i8…u128`, `f32`, `f64`), `String`, `Bytes`, `Bool`, `Symbol`, `Nil`, immutable `Array<T: Sendable>`, immutable `Map<K: Sendable, V: Sendable>`, immutable `Set<T: Sendable>`, `Option<T: Sendable>`, `Result<T: Sendable, E: Sendable>`.

Built-in non-Sendable types: `Cell<T>`, `RefCell<T>`, raw managed-mode references with mutable interiors, file handles, sockets (caller must open per-actor).

#### 9.4.3 Manual opt-out

A type MAY mark itself `@nonsendable` to prevent auto-derive:

```garnet
@nonsendable
struct ConnectionPool {
  conns: Array<Connection>,
  in_flight: Cell<Int>,           # interior mutability → would fail auto-derive anyway
}
```

The compiler MUST reject attempts to send a `@nonsendable` value across an actor boundary with `error E0277: ConnectionPool does not implement Sendable`.

#### 9.4.4 Manual opt-in (with safety obligation)

In rare cases a programmer may need to mark a type Sendable that does not auto-derive (e.g., a thread-safe lock-free queue implemented with internal `unsafe`). The form is:

```garnet
unsafe impl Sendable for LockFreeQueue<T: Sendable> { }
```

The `unsafe impl` keyword (REQUIRED) signals that the programmer asserts Sendable correctness manually; the compiler does not check it. This matches Rust's `unsafe impl Send` discipline.

#### 9.4.5 Enforcement at protocol declaration

At every actor `protocol` declaration (per §9.1), the compiler MUST verify:

- Every parameter type implements Sendable.
- The return type (if any) implements Sendable.

Failure produces `error E0902: protocol parameter type T does not implement Sendable; cannot cross actor boundary`. This is a *declaration-site* check, not a use-site check. By rejecting at declaration, Garnet guarantees that any actor whose protocol type-checks can be safely instantiated and messaged.

#### 9.4.6 Cross-mode interaction

Managed-mode types implement Sendable when they satisfy §9.4.2 #3 (frozen). Safe-mode types implement Sendable per §9.4.2 #4. A `protocol` declared in a managed-mode actor MAY accept managed-mode Sendable types; a `protocol` declared in a safe-mode actor MAY accept safe-mode Sendable types. Cross-mode protocols (a safe actor receiving a managed-mode value) require explicit boundary bridging — typically the managed value is frozen and adopted as a shared reference.

#### 9.4.7 Difference from Swift

Swift's `Sendable` evolved over multiple releases; v1.0 takes the SE-0302 mature form and makes one Garnet-specific refinement: **Sendable is checked at protocol declaration, not at every send site**. Swift checks at each `send` call, which produces O(n) duplicate diagnostics for the same type used in many sends. Garnet's declaration-site check yields O(1) diagnostics per protocol while preserving the same soundness guarantee.

#### 9.4.8 Soundness

> **Actor Isolation Theorem [v1.0]**
>
> If actor `A` sends value `v: T` to actor `B`, and `T: Sendable` per the rules of §9.4.2–§9.4.4, then `B` cannot observe a write performed by `A` to `v` after the send, and `A` cannot observe a write performed by `B` to `v` after receipt.
>
> **Proof sketch.** For frozen managed values, immutability after send is a structural invariant — there are no `var` fields to mutate. For safe-mode owned values, the move discipline (B4 of §8.6) ensures `A` cannot access `v` after sending it. For safe-mode shared references, no reference is mutable, so concurrent mutation cannot occur. The only escape hatch is `unsafe impl Sendable`, which is by definition an asserted obligation, not a checked one.

---

## 10. Recursive Execution Guardrails *(unchanged from v0.3 §10)*

### 10.1 Recursion depth limits [v0.3 — concrete annotation syntax]

```
depth-annotation := "@max_depth" "(" integer ")"
```

`@max_depth(N)` MUST appear on any function definition that directly or transitively performs recursive agent spawning. The compiler MUST reject programs where a spawn chain could exceed the annotated depth.

```garnet
@max_depth(3)
def analyze_document(doc) {
  let chunks = doc.split_sections()
  let results = chunks |> map(|chunk| {
    spawn AnalysisAgent.analyze(chunk)   # depth 1
  })
  merge_results(results)
}
```

Default depth if unannotated is 1 (single layer of delegation). The compiler MUST emit a warning for functions that spawn agents without an explicit `@max_depth` annotation.

### 10.2 Asynchronous fan-out caps [v0.3]

```
fanout-annotation := "@fan_out" "(" integer ")"
```

`@fan_out(K)` MUST appear on any parallel spawn site. The runtime MUST reject attempts to exceed `K` simultaneous sub-agents.

```garnet
@max_depth(2)
@fan_out(10)
def parallel_search(queries) {
  queries |> map(|q| spawn SearchAgent.search(q))
           |> await_all()
}
```

### 10.3 Metadata validation [v0.3]

```
metadata-annotation := "@require_metadata"
```

`@require_metadata` on a parameter position requires that the argument carries Memory Manager metadata. The Memory Manager MAY refuse the call if flat retrieval would suffice.

```garnet
def recursive_retrieve(@require_metadata context: Memory::Semantic) {
  context.deep_search(query)
}
```

### 10.4 Scope *(unchanged from v0.2 §5.4)*

§10 constrains program structure, not program semantics. A compliant Garnet implementation MAY choose any enforcement strategy (static analysis, runtime checks, or both) that rejects non-compliant programs with clear diagnostics.

---

## 11. Type System Foundations *(extended from v0.3 §11; §§11.5–11.8 added/extended in v1.0)*

### 11.1 Progressive disclosure spectrum

Garnet's type system is the formal embodiment of the dual-mode philosophy. It provides four levels of type discipline, each a strict superset of the previous:

| Level | Name | Where | Annotations | Guarantees |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Dynamic | Managed mode, no annotations | None required | Runtime type errors only |
| 1 | Gradual | Managed mode with annotations | Optional type hints | Compile-time checks where annotated; runtime checks at boundaries |
| 2 | Static | Managed mode, fully annotated | All types specified | Full compile-time type safety; no runtime type errors |
| 3 | Affine | `@safe` mode | Types + ownership | Compile-time type safety + memory safety + data-race freedom |

A program at Level 0 is valid at Level 3 — the compiler infers the tightest constraints. A program at Level 3 works at Level 0 — ownership annotations become documentation, ARC handles memory.

**This is a novel contribution (MIT-defensible).** No existing production language provides a formally continuous type-discipline spectrum from fully dynamic to affine-typed within one coherent syntax. TypeScript offers Levels 0–2 but no ownership. Rust offers Levels 2–3 but no dynamic mode. Swift offers Levels 1–2 with partial ownership (move-only types, experimental). Garnet spans all four.

**Formal basis:** Paper V §3 defines the core calculus as λ_managed (Levels 0–2) + λ_safe (Level 3) with a bridging judgment at the boundary. The progressive disclosure spectrum maps to these sub-calculi: Levels 0–2 inhabit λ_managed with increasing constraint density, and Level 3 transitions to λ_safe with affine rules.

**Theorem (Progressive Disclosure Monotonicity) [v0.3]:**

> Let ⊢_N denote "type-checks at level N" for N ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}. Then for any well-formed Garnet program P:

### 11.2 Built-in types

```
# Numeric types
Int          # arbitrary-precision integer (managed); i64 (safe)
Float        # 64-bit IEEE 754
i8, i16, i32, i64, i128     # safe mode sized integers
u8, u16, u32, u64, u128     # safe mode unsigned integers
f32, f64                     # safe mode sized floats

# Text
String       # UTF-8, immutable by default, COW semantics in managed mode
Bytes        # raw byte buffer

# Boolean
Bool         # true | false

# Collections (managed mode, ARC-backed)
Array<T>     # dynamic array
Map<K, V>    # ordered hash map
Set<T>       # hash set

# Option and Result
Option<T>    # Some(T) | None
Result<T, E> # Ok(T) | Err(E)

# Special
Nil          # the type of nil (managed mode only; safe mode uses Option)
Symbol       # interned string (:ok, :error, etc.)
```

### 11.3 User-defined types

```
struct-decl := ("pub")? "struct" ident ("<" type-params ">")? "{" field-decl* "}"
field-decl  := ("pub")? ident ":" type ("=" expr)?

enum-decl   := ("pub")? "enum" ident ("<" type-params ">")? "{" variant* "}"
variant     := ident ("(" type ("," type)* ")")?

trait-decl  := ("pub")? "trait" ident ("<" type-params ">")? "{" trait-item* "}"
trait-item  := fn-sig | def-sig | const-decl
fn-sig      := "fn" ident "(" typed-params ")" "->" type
def-sig     := "def" ident "(" param-list ")"

impl-block  := "impl" ("<" type-params ">")? type ("for" trait)? "{" (managed-fn | safe-fn)* "}"
```

```garnet
struct Config {
  pub host: String,
  pub port: Int = 8080,
  timeout: Float = 30.0,
}

enum BuildResult {
  Success(Artifact),
  Failure(String),
  Timeout,
}

trait Serializable {
  fn serialize(borrow self) -> Bytes
  fn deserialize(data: Bytes) -> Result<Self, SerializeError>
}
```

**Design rationale:** Structs, enums, and traits follow Rust's algebraic type system — proven to be the strongest foundation for both type safety and pattern matching. The `impl` block separates data (struct) from behavior (methods), which is essential for safe mode's ownership discipline. In managed mode, these types are ARC-managed; in safe mode, they follow ownership rules.

### 11.4 Generics [v0.3, monomorphization spec moved to §11.6]

```garnet
def identity<T>(x: T) -> T { x }

fn swap<T>(own a: T, own b: T) -> (T, T) { (b, a) }

struct Stack<T> {
  items: Array<T>,
}
```

The compilation strategy for generics depends on mode and is specified normatively in §11.6.

### 11.5 Trait coherence [v1.0 — addresses Phase 1B Rust gap #5; extended from v0.3 §11.5]

Trait coherence governs when two different `impl` blocks may exist for overlapping types. Garnet adopts Rust's proven coherence model. v0.3 §11.5 stated the orphan rule informally; v1.0 specifies it as a checking algorithm.

#### 11.5.1 The Orphan Rule (per Rust RFC 1023)

An `impl <T*> Trait<TParams> for Type<TArgs>` is allowed only if at least one of the following holds:

1. `Trait` is defined in the current module, OR
2. `Type` is defined in the current module, OR
3. There exists a *covered local type parameter* — a type parameter `P ∈ T*` that appears as a component of `TParams` or `TArgs` such that no uncovered foreign type appears before it.

#### 11.5.2 Coverage algorithm (formal)

For a type `T<U₁, U₂, …, Uₙ>`, a type parameter `P` is *covered* by `T` if `P` appears as one of the `Uᵢ`. A foreign type `F` is *uncovered* if it appears before any covered local type parameter in left-to-right order.

```
is_orphan_legal(impl, current_module):
    trait = impl.trait
    trait_args = impl.trait_args      # [Type] including the receiver
    if trait.module == current_module: return true
    for arg in trait_args:
        if arg.module == current_module: return true
    for arg in trait_args:
        if arg is a type-param P and is_covered(P, trait_args, current_module):
            return true
    return false

is_covered(param, args, current_module):
    for arg in args:
        if arg is a generic type T and arg.module == current_module:
            for sub in arg.type_args:
                if sub == param: return true
        elif arg.module != current_module:
            return false   # uncovered foreign type appears first → fail rule 3
    return false
```

#### 11.5.3 Overlap check

After orphan check passes, the compiler MUST verify no two impls overlap. Two impls `impl A for X` and `impl A for Y` overlap iff there exists a type `Z` such that `Z` matches both `X` and `Y` (via type inference + variance + lifetime erasure).

The algorithm is exponential in worst case but polynomial in practice. Implementations MAY use Rust's `chalk` solver design, OR may implement a simpler unification-based check that errs on the side of over-rejecting (rejected programs can be refactored).

#### 11.5.4 Diagnostic guarantee

When orphan-rule violation OR overlap is detected, the compiler MUST produce a diagnostic that:

1. Names the offending `impl`.
2. For orphan violation: cites which of the three conditions failed AND suggests either moving the impl to the trait-defining module or the type-defining module.
3. For overlap: shows both impls AND a witness type matching both, AND suggests using the orphan rule to disambiguate.

#### 11.5.5 Deferred subtleties (v0.4)

Specialization, negative bounds (`where T: !Copy`), and conditional blanket impls are NOT part of v1.0. A v0.4 RFC will address specialization following Rust's specialization-lite proposal. Until then, the simple orphan rule provides predictable behavior at the cost of some expressiveness — a defensible trade-off.

### 11.6 Monomorphization & zero-cost abstractions [v1.0 — addresses Phase 1B Rust gap #7]

Garnet's mode-aware compilation strategy for generics is normatively specified.

#### 11.6.1 Compilation strategy

| Mode | Strategy | Generic bound | Code-size impact |
|------|----------|---------------|------------------|
| Safe (`@safe`) | Monomorphization | Per concrete type instantiation | Higher (one copy per instantiation) |
| Managed | Type erasure with vtable | One copy with dynamic dispatch | Lower (one copy total) |

Selection is determined by the enclosing module's mode. A generic function defined in a `@safe` module is monomorphized at every call site. A generic function defined in a managed-mode module is type-erased to a single `impl` operating on a uniform value representation.

#### 11.6.2 Monomorphization rules (safe mode)

For each concrete instantiation `f<T = U₁, …, Tₙ = Uₙ>` reachable from program entry, the compiler MUST emit a specialized copy of `f` with all type parameters substituted by their concrete types. The compiler MUST inline calls to small monomorphized functions (size threshold implementation-defined; default ≤ 50 instructions).

**Polymorphic recursion is forbidden in safe mode.** A function `f<T>` MUST NOT contain a call to `f<U>` where `U ≠ T` along any reachable code path. Polymorphic recursion would require unbounded code generation. Detection is by static call-graph analysis. Diagnostic: `error E0275: overflow evaluating the requirement` with suggestion to convert to `dyn Trait` (managed mode escape hatch).

#### 11.6.3 Trait objects (`dyn Trait`) in safe mode

Safe mode supports trait objects via `dyn Trait` syntax for cases where monomorphization is undesired (e.g., heterogeneous collections):

```garnet
@safe
fn process_all(items: Array<Box<dyn Drawable>>) {
  for item in items {
    item.draw()    # vtable dispatch
  }
}
```

`dyn Trait` representation: a fat pointer (data pointer + vtable pointer). The vtable is computed at compile time per `(Trait, ConcreteType)` pair. Method dispatch is one indirection. This is identical to Rust's `dyn Trait` ABI.

Object safety: a trait MAY be used as `dyn Trait` only if it satisfies the *object safety* rules:
- All methods take `&self`, `&mut self`, or `Box<Self>`.
- No method is generic over additional type parameters.
- No method returns `Self`.

These rules are checked at the use site. Violations produce `error E0038: the trait T cannot be made into an object`.

#### 11.6.4 Type erasure (managed mode)

Managed-mode generics compile to a single function operating on a uniform value representation (typically a tagged 128-bit value or a boxed pointer). Type parameters are erased at runtime; bounds are checked dynamically at the entry of the function.

Cost: one indirection per generic operation (vs. zero in safe mode), plus tag-checking overhead (~2–5%).

#### 11.6.5 Zero-cost abstraction guarantee

> **Zero-Cost Abstraction Theorem [v1.0]**
>
> For any `@safe` generic function `f<T>` that is monomorphized to `f<U>`, the compiled machine code for `f<U>` is equivalent (up to compiler optimization) to a hand-written non-generic `f_for_U` with U substituted for T at the source level.
>
> **Proof sketch.** Monomorphization performs textual substitution at the IR level; the resulting IR is structurally identical to what a programmer would write by hand. Standard compiler optimizations (inlining, constant folding, dead-code elimination) apply identically. There is no runtime dispatch, no boxing, no allocation that the hand-written form would not also produce.

This theorem grounds Paper III's "near-Rust performance for safe mode" claim: at the IR level, safe-mode generics ARE Rust generics modulo surface syntax.

#### 11.6.6 Boundary behavior

A safe-mode `fn f<T>(x: T)` called from managed-mode code is monomorphized for the managed-mode argument's concrete type. If the managed-mode value's type is not statically known (Level 0 — Dynamic), the call site requires a runtime type test followed by dispatch to the appropriate monomorphization. The compiler MAY hoist this check or fall back to type erasure for managed-mode-only call paths; this choice is implementation-defined.

### 11.7 `@dynamic` method dispatch table [v1.0 — addresses Phase 1B Ruby gap #9]

Ruby's metaprogramming culture leans on per-instance method addition (`define_method`, `singleton_class`, `method_missing`). v1.0 specifies a Garnet equivalent gated behind the `@dynamic` annotation, scoped strictly to managed mode.

#### 11.7.1 Grammar

```
dynamic-decl := "@dynamic" struct-decl
              | "@dynamic" impl-block
```

A struct annotated `@dynamic` enables runtime method addition to its instances. An impl block annotated `@dynamic` enables runtime method addition to that specific (type, trait) pair.

```garnet
@dynamic
struct Service {
  name: String,
}

let s = Service::new("auth")
s.def_method(:health_check) do
  http_get("https://#{name}/health").status == 200
end

s.health_check()        # invokes the runtime-added method
```

#### 11.7.2 Per-instance method table

Every `@dynamic` instance carries a private method table:

```
DynamicMethodTable := Map<Symbol, Closure>
```

The table is lazily allocated on first `def_method` call (zero overhead until used). Each entry maps a method name (Symbol) to a Closure capturing `self` plus any explicit captures.

#### 11.7.3 Dispatch order

When a method is called on a `@dynamic` value, the runtime MUST consult dispatch in this order:

1. **Per-instance dynamic table.** If the method is in the instance's `DynamicMethodTable`, invoke it.
2. **Static `impl` blocks.** Standard static method resolution (per §11.3).
3. **`method_missing` fallback.** If neither resolves and the type defines `def method_missing(name: Symbol, args: Array<Any>)`, invoke it with the resolved name and arguments.
4. **`NoMethodError`.** Raise an exception.

This matches Ruby's documented dispatch order (Pickaxe §28 "Runtime Callbacks") with one Garnet-specific clarification: per-instance methods *override* class-level methods, not vice versa. Ruby is more nuanced; Garnet's choice is the predictable one.

#### 11.7.4 Runtime API

```garnet
@dynamic
struct Foo { … }

impl Foo {
  fn def_method(self, name: Symbol, body: Closure)         # add a method
  fn undef_method(self, name: Symbol)                       # remove a method
  fn responds_to?(self, name: Symbol) -> Bool              # introspect
  fn method_names(self) -> Array<Symbol>                    # all dynamic + static method names
}
```

`def_method` MUST overwrite any existing entry for `name`. `undef_method` MUST remove only the dynamic-table entry; static methods cannot be removed.

#### 11.7.5 Performance contract

- `@dynamic` values pay a constant-overhead Map lookup per method call (~3–10 ns on commodity hardware in 2026).
- Non-`@dynamic` values pay nothing.
- The runtime MAY cache the resolved method per call site (inline cache) to amortize the lookup cost.

Static method calls on `@dynamic` types MUST NOT pay the lookup overhead if the call site is monomorphizable — i.e., if the compiler can prove that no `def_method` for the called name has been called on this instance.

#### 11.7.6 Safe-mode prohibition

`@dynamic` is REJECTED in `@safe` modules. Diagnostic: `error E0901: @dynamic is not permitted in @safe modules; use a trait + Box<dyn Trait> instead`. Rationale: dynamic method addition undermines the static-dispatch guarantee that justifies safe mode's performance claims (§11.6.5).

#### 11.7.7 Interaction with `Sendable`

`@dynamic` values are NOT auto-Sendable. Sending a `@dynamic` value across an actor boundary risks racing on the per-instance method table. Programmers needing cross-actor dynamic dispatch should use protocols (§9.1) — the actor-protocol design exists precisely for this case.

### 11.8 Structural protocols (duck typing) [v1.0 — addresses Phase 1B Ruby gap #10]

Garnet's typing should permit Ruby-style "if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck" expression at the type-system layer. v1.0 introduces top-level `protocol` declarations as *structural types*.

#### 11.8.1 Grammar

```
struct-protocol-decl := ("pub")? "protocol" ident ("<" type-params ">")? "{" proto-item* "}"
proto-item           := fn-sig | def-sig
```

(Disambiguated from actor-internal `protocol` per §9.1's note.)

```garnet
protocol Drawable {
  def draw()
  def bounding_box() -> Rect
}
```

A type satisfies `Drawable` if it has methods `draw()` and `bounding_box() -> Rect` with compatible signatures. **No `impl Drawable for T` block is required.**

#### 11.8.2 Static structural typing (managed mode)

In managed mode, a function may accept a structural protocol as a parameter type:

```garnet
def render_all(items: Array<Drawable>) {
  for item in items {
    item.draw()
  }
}

struct Circle { radius: Float }
impl Circle {
  def draw() { /* … */ }
  def bounding_box() -> Rect { /* … */ }
}

render_all([Circle::new(1.0), Circle::new(2.0)])    # compiles — Circle satisfies Drawable structurally
```

The compiler performs a *structural compatibility check* at the call site:

```
satisfies(T, P):
    for fn-sig (name, params, ret) in P.items:
        if T does not have a method `name` with compatible (params, ret): return false
    return true
```

Compatibility is method-signature equality up to parameter-name renaming. Generic methods on T match generic items on P only if the type parameters unify.

#### 11.8.3 Runtime cast

For cases where the protocol cannot be statically proven (Level 0 / Level 1):

```garnet
let unknown: Any = receive_from_network()
match unknown {
  d as Drawable => d.draw(),
  _ => log("not drawable")
}
```

`as Protocol` performs a runtime cast: succeeds if the value's class has the required methods, raises `ProtocolError` if not.

#### 11.8.4 Differences from Go interfaces and Rust traits

| Feature | Go interface | Rust trait | Garnet protocol [v1.0] |
|---------|--------------|------------|------------------------|
| Implementation declaration | None — implicit | `impl Trait for T` required | Implicit; `impl P for T` permitted as documentation |
| Coherence rule | None (any package satisfies) | Orphan rule | Orphan rule applies only to `impl P for T` declarations |
| Static dispatch | Limited (interface always boxed) | Yes (`impl Trait` syntax) | Yes (Level 2+ in managed mode) |
| Method addition at runtime | No | No | Yes via §11.7 `@dynamic` (orthogonal) |

The Garnet design splits the difference: implicit conformance like Go (low ceremony), but optional `impl` declarations for documentation, traceability in IDEs, and orphan-rule discipline.

#### 11.8.5 Safe-mode behavior

Safe-mode protocols MUST resolve at compile time. A safe-mode function accepting a protocol parameter is implicitly generic over the concrete satisfying type:

```garnet
@safe
fn render(item: Drawable) -> ()    # equivalent to fn render<T: Drawable>(item: T)
```

This monomorphizes per call site (per §11.6). Runtime `as Protocol` cast is REJECTED in safe mode; use `match item { … }` over an enum if heterogeneity is needed.

#### 11.8.6 Difference between top-level `protocol` and `trait`

Both top-level `protocol` and `trait` declare a method contract. The semantic difference:

- `trait`: nominal — a type satisfies it ONLY via explicit `impl Trait for T`.
- `protocol`: structural — a type satisfies it via signature compatibility, regardless of `impl` declaration.

When in doubt, prefer `trait` for stable APIs (gives the trait author control) and `protocol` for orchestration glue (gives the consumer flexibility).

## 13. What a v1.0 Implementation Owes [v1.0 — extended from v0.3 §13]

Rungs 2–4 of the engineering ladder MUST be implementable against this spec:

- **Rung 2 (parser):** MUST parse all grammar productions in §§2–11. The existing v0.2/v0.3 parser covers most sections; v1.0 adds: (a) `do…end` and brace-block arguments (§5.4.1); (b) `yield`/`next` keywords (§5.4); (c) `@dynamic` annotation on struct/impl (§11.7); (d) top-level `protocol` declarations (§11.8); (e) `Sendable` and `@nonsendable` markers (§9.4); (f) `dyn Trait` syntax (§11.6.3).

| 8. TurboQuant = runtime, not language-core | §4.3 (out of scope), OQ-6 (position: nothing) |

---

## 15. REPL Specification [v1.0 — addresses Phase 1B Ruby gap #11]

A REPL ("read-eval-print loop") is a first-class Garnet experience. v1.0 specifies the REPL's surface contract; implementation details (line editing, terminal escape codes, history file format) belong to the Compiler Architecture Specification.

### 15.1 Invocation and entry

```
$ garnet repl
Garnet 1.0.0 (managed mode, no project)
Type :help for commands, :quit to exit.

>>>
```

`garnet repl` MAY be invoked outside any project (free-standing scratch session) or inside a project (loads `Garnet.toml` and exposes the project's modules).

### 15.2 Input model

Each input is one of:

1. **An expression.** Evaluated; the value is printed with type information.
2. **A statement.** Evaluated; nothing is printed unless the statement raises.
3. **A REPL command** (starts with `:`). See §15.6.

Multiline input is detected when the parser cannot terminate on a complete expression at the end of a line — open braces, open parens, unfinished `try…ensure`, etc. The prompt switches from `>>>` to `...` to indicate continuation.

```
>>> def square(x) {
...   x * x
... }
=> def square(x: Any) -> Any         # signature inferred

>>> square(7)
=> 49 : Int
```

### 15.3 Binding persistence

Top-level bindings MUST persist across inputs. The REPL maintains a single managed-mode `Module` whose name is `Repl`. All `let`/`var`/`def`/`struct`/`enum`/`impl`/`use` declarations modify this module.

A redefinition (e.g., `def square(x) { x + 1 }` after the previous example) MUST silently replace the prior binding. The new definition takes effect immediately for new calls; any ongoing actor handlers retain the old binding until the actor reloads (per §9 hot-reload semantics).

### 15.4 Mode

The REPL operates in managed mode by default. To experiment with safe-mode code, the user enters a multi-line `@safe module` block. The REPL MUST NOT permit a single safe-mode top-level statement; safe code requires a module envelope.

```
>>> @safe module Local {
...   fn double(own x: Int) -> Int {
...     x * 2
...   }
... }
=> module Local

>>> Local.double(21)
=> 42 : Int
```

### 15.5 Type display rules

After every expression, the REPL MUST print the value followed by ` : ` and the inferred type. For values implementing a custom `to_s` method, the printed value uses that method; otherwise a debug representation (Rust-like `{:?}`) is used.

For long values (> 80 chars rendered, > 5 nested levels), the REPL MAY truncate with `…` and provide a `:expand` command to view in full.

### 15.6 REPL commands

The following commands MUST be supported. Commands begin with `:` to disambiguate from expressions.

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `:help` | Show this command table |
| `:quit` / `:q` | Exit the REPL |
| `:type <expr>` / `:t <expr>` | Print the inferred type of `<expr>` without evaluating |
| `:imports` | List currently loaded modules |
| `:use <path>` | Equivalent to `use <path>` — load a module |
| `:reload` | Re-read all loaded modules from disk |
| `:reset` | Clear all REPL bindings; equivalent to restarting |
| `:history` | Print recent inputs |
| `:edit` | Open the most recent multi-line input in `$EDITOR`, then re-evaluate |
| `:time <expr>` | Evaluate `<expr>` and print elapsed time |
| `:bench <expr>` | Run `<expr>` 1000× and report stats |
| `:expand <name>` | Show the un-truncated value of the named binding |

### 15.7 History persistence

The REPL MUST persist input history to `~/.garnet/repl_history` (path overridable via `GARNET_HISTORY_PATH` env var). Lines are appended after each input. History is loaded on startup. Maximum history size is implementation-defined; default 5000 lines.

### 15.8 Safe-mode REPL execution

When evaluating safe-mode code (per §15.4), the REPL MUST run the full borrow checker and lifetime inference (§8.5–8.6). Diagnostics MUST be displayed inline with the same quality as `garnet check`.

### 15.9 Performance contract

REPL evaluation latency for trivial expressions (e.g., `1 + 1`) MUST be ≤ 10 ms on commodity 2026 hardware. This precludes JIT compilation per input (which would amortize poorly); the REPL implementation SHOULD use a tree-walk interpreter with on-demand AST caching.

### 15.10 Differences from Ruby's `irb` and Rust's evcxr

- **Ruby `irb`:** Garnet REPL adds explicit type display and safe-mode support; otherwise behaves analogously.
- **Rust `evcxr`:** Garnet REPL avoids requiring `let` rebinding for redefinition; in Garnet, `def square(x) { … }` followed by a redefinition silently replaces the binding, mirroring Ruby's interactive flow.

The blended model is, by design, "what a Ruby developer expects, with type information added."

## 16. Tooling Ergonomics Summary [v1.0 — addresses Phase 1B Swift gap #3; full treatment in Paper VII]

Garnet's tooling story is a research deliverable (Paper VII — Implementation Ladder) but its high-level shape is normative: the language MUST be usable through a single CLI (`garnet`) with consistent UX across local development, package management, and continuous integration.

### 16.1 The single-CLI principle

A Garnet developer interacts with the toolchain through one binary, `garnet`, with sub-commands for every workflow:

| Sub-command | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `garnet new <name>` | Create a new project with template scaffolding |
| `garnet init` | Initialize a Garnet project in the current directory |
| `garnet build` | Compile the project (produces release binary by default) |
| `garnet build --deterministic` | Produce a manifest-pinned reproducible build (per Paper VI C7) |
| `garnet build --deterministic --sign` | Add manifest signature (v3.4 ManifestSig) |
| `garnet run` | Build and execute the project's entry module |
| `garnet test` | Run the project's test suite |
| `garnet check` | Type-check + borrow-check without producing a binary |
| `garnet fmt` | Auto-format source (single canonical style; no options) |
| `garnet repl` | Launch the REPL (per §15) |
| `garnet doc` | Generate API documentation from doc comments |
| `garnet audit` | Run `cargo-geiger`-equivalent dependency safety scan (v3.5 FFIGeiger) |
| `garnet verify <manifest>` | Verify a deterministic-build manifest (v3.4 ManifestSig) |
| `garnet convert <lang> <file>` | Convert source from another language to Garnet (v4.1) |

Inspired by Cargo (Rust) and SwiftPM (Swift), with the deliberate choice to keep the CLI flat (no `garnet pkg add`-style nesting beyond two levels).

### 16.2 Project layout

```
my_project/
├── Garnet.toml          # project manifest (name, version, dependencies, @caps declarations)
├── src/
│   └── main.garnet      # entry module
├── tests/
│   └── test_main.garnet # tests
├── examples/            # example programs
├── .garnet-cache/       # compiler-as-agent cache (HMAC-protected, gitignored)
└── .gitignore           # generated by `garnet new`, excludes .garnet-cache/
```

### 16.3 Manifest (`Garnet.toml`) shape

```toml
[project]
name = "my_project"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "v1.0"

[dependencies]
http = "0.5"

[caps]                   # v3.4 CapCaps — top-level capability declarations
required = ["fs", "net"]

[build]
deterministic = true     # default-on for v3.4+
sign = true              # v3.4 ManifestSig
```

### 16.4 Documentation comment syntax

```garnet
## A short summary of the function.
##
## # Examples
##
## ```garnet
## let result = fibonacci(10)
## assert_eq(55, result)
## ```
def fibonacci(n) { ... }
```

`##` introduces a doc comment. Doc comments support markdown. `garnet doc` extracts them into a static HTML site.

### 16.5 Cross-platform installer (v4.2 — see Paper VII)

Per the v4.2 plan, Garnet ships as MSI (Windows), `.pkg` (macOS), `.deb`/`.rpm` (Linux), and a `rustup`-style universal shell installer. UX target: "install + create + run" in under two minutes on a clean machine.

### 16.6 Why the single-CLI principle matters

Paper III §3.1 cites Swift's "package tooling and language ergonomics can reinforce one another" as the third Swift contribution. Ruby's tooling fragmentation (separate gem/bundle/rake/rubocop/rspec binaries with overlapping configs) is the canonical anti-pattern. Garnet adopts Swift/Cargo's single-binary discipline as a structural commitment that prevents the Ruby-style fragmentation from creeping in over time.

Full architecture, command-by-command behavior, and rollout sequencing is the subject of Paper VII (Implementation Ladder).
