# Contributing to Garnet

*"In the multitude of counsellors there is safety." — Proverbs 11:14*

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Garnet programming language. This document explains how the project is organized, how to set up a development environment, and what we expect from contributors.

## Code of Conduct

Garnet's community is built on mutual respect, intellectual honesty, and a shared commitment to making a serious programming language. We expect all contributors to:

- Treat others with respect, even in heated technical debates
- Lead with evidence and reasoning, not appeals to authority
- Be generous with explanations — assume good questions, not malice
- Credit prior art and acknowledge influences
- Remember that the project was started by a small team with big ambitions

Harassment, gatekeeping, or dismissive behavior will not be tolerated.

## How the Project Works

### Architecture Overview

Garnet is a **dual-mode, agent-native programming language** that reconciles Rust's compile-time safety with Ruby's expressive ergonomics, designed for long-horizon agentic systems. Key concepts:

- **Managed mode** (default) — ARC memory, dynamic-ish types, Ruby-like surface syntax
- **Safe mode** (`@safe`) — ownership + borrowing, static types, Rust-level performance
- **First-class memory abstractions** — working, episodic, semantic, and procedural memory units
- **Typed actors** — compiler-enforced message protocols for concurrent systems
- **Recursive execution guardrails** — `@max_depth`, `@fan_out` annotations for agent spawn safety
- **Compiler-as-agent cache** — learns from compilation history to optimize future builds

### Workspace Structure

The repository is organized as a Rust Cargo workspace:

```
.
├── Cargo.toml                          # workspace manifest
├── garnet-parser-v0.3/                 # Rung 2.1: lexer + recursive-descent parser (213 tests)
├── garnet-interp-v0.3/                 # Rung 3: tree-walk interpreter + REPL (372 tests)
├── garnet-check-v0.3/                  # Rung 4: safe-mode validator + borrow checker (35 tests)
├── garnet-memory-v0.3/                 # Rung 5: four memory primitives reference (41 tests)
├── garnet-actor-runtime/               # Rung 6: concurrent actor runtime (33+5 reload tests)
├── garnet-stdlib/                      # standard library (74 tests)
├── garnet-convert/                     # multi-source converter (85 tests)
├── garnet-cli/                         # CLI binary: garnet parse/check/run/eval/repl (12 smoke)
└── xtask/                              # meta: determinism harness (7× consistency)
```

Total: ~22K LOC Rust, 857+ passing tests, zero clippy warnings with `-D warnings`.

### Versioning policy

Garnet uses **one public release version, plus honest independent crate semver**:

- The **public release version** is `garnet-cli`, which inherits
  `[workspace.package].version` (currently **0.8.2**) via `version.workspace = true`.
  This is what `garnet --version`, the git tag, and the release assets carry.
- The **internal library crates** (`garnet-parser`, `garnet-check`, `garnet-interp`,
  `garnet-memory`, `garnet-vm`, `garnet-stdlib`, `garnet-convert`, …) carry their
  **own** `[package] version` reflecting their actual API evolution (e.g. the parser
  at `0.3.x`). They are **not** force-bumped to match the release — that would
  overstate their maturity. Each inter-crate path dependency keeps an explicit
  `version = "x.y.z"` pin matching that crate's real version: this is **required**,
  because the workspace's `cargo deny` config bans wildcard (`*`) dependencies, and a
  path dep with no version resolves to a wildcard. So the pins are intentional, not
  redundant — they encode the honest per-crate version.

This keeps the user-facing version coherent while keeping per-crate versions honest.
If a future decision treats the workspace as a single-version monorepo, that is a
deliberate policy change (set every crate to `version.workspace = true` and pin
inter-crate deps to the shared version), not drift.

### The Language Spec

The normative specification is `spec/GARNET_v1_0_Mini_Spec.md`. This is the source of truth for the grammar, semantics, mode boundaries, actor protocols, and type system. All crates implement against this spec.

### Research Papers

The foundational research lives in `research/`:
- Paper I — Rust deep dive
- Paper II — Ruby deep dive
- Paper III — Garnet synthesis (v2.1)
- Paper IV — Garnet for agentic systems (v2.1.1)
- Paper V — Formal grounding (affine type theory, RustBelt)
- Paper VI — Empirical validation protocol
- Paper VII — Implementation ladder and tooling

## Setting Up a Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** 1.95+ (stable) — install via `rustup`; CI also tracks current stable
- **Python 3.10+** for test fixtures and converter tests (optional)
- **SQLite3** CLI for inspecting `.garnet-cache/` databases (optional)

### Build

```bash
cargo build --workspace              # build all crates
cargo test  --workspace --no-fail-fast  # run full test suite (~857 tests)
```

### Run the CLI

```bash
cargo run -p garnet-cli -- --help
cargo run -p garnet-cli -- repl      # interactive REPL
cargo run -p garnet-cli -- check examples/greeter_actor.garnet
```

### Determinism Verification

```bash
cargo run -p xtask -- seven-run      # runs test suite 7×, asserts identical pass/fail
```

### Stress Tests (opt-in)

```bash
cargo test --workspace -- --ignored  # 6 stress tests at 100K+ scale
```

## Contribution Workflow

1. **Open an issue** describing the bug, feature, or RFC. Describe the problem, not just the solution.
2. **Discuss** — maintainers will triage and label. For large features, we may ask for a brief design note.
3. **Fork and branch** — create a branch off `main`. Name it `feat/`, `fix/`, or `doc/` prefixed.
4. **Write tests** — all new code must have tests. No exceptions.
5. **Pass CI** — your PR must pass `cargo test --workspace`, `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`, and the 7× determinism harness.
6. **Submit a PR** — link the issue, describe what changed, note any breaking changes.
7. **Review** — at least one maintainer review is required before merge.

### Testing Expectations

| Crate | Minimum coverage expectation |
|---|---|
| garnet-parser-v0.3 | All grammar productions + negative tests for malformed input |
| garnet-interp-v0.3 | Every AST node type + end-to-end programs |
| garnet-check-v0.3 | All violation types + annotation bounds |
| garnet-memory-v0.3 | Property-based tests for R+R+I decay |
| garnet-actor-runtime | Tell, ask, lifecycle + hot-reload migration |
| garnet-convert | Corpus tests: Rust → Garnet → output parity |
| garnet-cli | Subprocess smoke tests for every subcommand |

### Commit Message Convention

We use a lightweight convention:

```
type(scope): brief description

type: feat | fix | doc | refactor | test | chore | perf
scope: parser, interp, check, memory, actor, stdlib, convert, cli, xtask, spec
```

Examples:
- `feat(interp): add pattern matching for enum destructuring`
- `fix(check): reject @safe fn with implicit allocation on hot path`
- `doc(spec): clarify actor protocol semantics in §9.3`

### Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] Tests added or updated
- [ ] `cargo test --workspace` passes
- [ ] `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` passes clean
- [ ] Commit messages follow the convention above
- [ ] Breaking changes documented in PR description
- [ ] If the spec changed, `spec/GARNET_v1_0_Mini_Spec.md` is updated

## Good First Contributions

Look for issues labeled `good-first-issue`. These are typically:

- Adding tests for uncovered grammar productions
- Improving error messages in the parser or checker
- Adding examples to `examples/`
- Writing documentation or fixing typos
- Extending the standard library with safe utility functions

### How to Add an Example

1. Create a `.garnet` file in `examples/` with a descriptive name
2. The file should compile and run via `garnet run examples/<name>.garnet`
3. Add a `//` comment at the top explaining what it demonstrates
4. Submit a PR with the example file

## Reporting Bugs

When reporting a bug, include:

1. The `.garnet` source that triggers the issue
2. Expected behavior (what the spec says should happen)
3. Actual behavior (what the compiler/interpreter did)
4. Garnet version (`garnet --version`)
5. Platform (OS, Rust version)

For **spec bugs** (where the spec itself is wrong or contradictory), reference the spec section number.

## Requesting Features

Feature requests should include:

1. What problem the feature solves
2. Why this approach over alternatives
3. Whether it changes existing semantics (breaking or additive)
4. A sketch of the surface syntax, if applicable
