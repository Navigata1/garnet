    that were read.

    What this binds, exactly: the metadata check, the open, the size bound,
    the read and the post-read check all address ONE descriptor, and with
    ``dir_fd`` every parent component is bound first. The leaf name is
    resolved twice — once for ``lstat``, once for ``open`` — under one bound
    parent, and a leaf swapped between the two is a finding by identity. A
    component that is a symlink when it is opened is refused by name. A
    parent renamed or replaced AFTER it was opened is survived, not reported:
    the read continues in the directory that was bound and the replacement
    is never read (review v2, V2-3). The bytes judged are the bytes this
    descriptor returned; a writer who changes the content before the read
    changes what is judged, which is the same as editing the file, and is not
    what this guards. What it excludes is judging one file's bytes under
    another file's identity.

    The post-read comparison (device, inode, size, mtime, ctime) is a change
    detector, not proof of byte immutability: a same-length in-place rewrite
    through a hard link that also restores mtime is caught only because ctime
    moves (review finding 5, reproduced), and a rename-over during the read is
    caught the same way, because unlinking the held inode moves its ctime.
    A concurrent writer to the SAME inode is outside this bound, and needs no
    privilege: on this host (APFS) an ordinary write through a shared
    writable ``mmap`` of a hard link moves none of the five fields (review
    v2 demonstrated it). That writer changes what is judged, not whose bytes
    are judged.

    ``O_NONBLOCK`` is set so that a regular file substituted by a FIFO between
    the check and the open cannot park the reporter waiting for a writer
    (review finding 4, reproduced); a regular file's reads are unaffected by
    it, and the descriptor type is checked before any read. Every rejection
    this function makes is an explicit ``ValueError`` naming the file,
    including a failed descriptor duplication at the binding step and a
    failed descriptor release; a release failure that follows a finding rides
    on that finding and both are reported. An absent file is
    ``EvidenceAbsent``, and absence plus a release failure is not pending.
