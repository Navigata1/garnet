"""Fail-closed, content-bound rolling review gate for Garnet's trust kernel.

Version 2 replaces the old "a companion path exists" signal with two proofs:

* Git must completely enumerate the candidate change set.  Discovery failures,
  malformed status streams, and deletions are findings, never empty-safe diffs.
* A trust-kernel change must carry a canonical ``*.review.json`` record under
  ``F_Project_Management/W_TRUST``.  Multiple records must form a linear,
  append-only succession; only the tip-most record binds the exact changed
  paths, their bytes, the reviewed head/tree, and an independent reviewer.

The module also exports ``verify_landed_review_marker`` for post-squash
closeouts.  That verifier deliberately does not require the discarded branch
head to be an ancestor of main.  It proves the landed commit is on upstream
main's first-parent history and that its exact first-parent landing edge, tree,
and trust-kernel content match the recorded digests while retaining the earlier
reviewed-head provenance.

# copy of this script.  Six designs were rejected by review, each with a
# reproduced construction — two that trusted a declaration or a pin, four that
# read the copy:
# declaration-first (a new marker could declare the old, narrower surface),
# commit-only pinning (replayable), a closed pin map bound to marker paths
# (preserved only the two pre-versioning markers; the next widening turned a
# valid v2 marker red), a regular expression over the constant (fooled by
# spelling), a parse of its binding (defeated by a walrus and an import), and a
# seal comment beside it (a copy can rebind the constant at its entry point and
# still carry the seal).  Any static reading of a copy can be made to disagree
# with what that copy does; so no copy is read.
#
# Instead each surface version after v1 has an ERA STONE: a canonical JSON file
# under ERA_STONE_DIR added by the change that introduced the version.  A
# landing's surface is the latest version whose stone was introduced at or
# before that landing on main's first-parent history, which is append-only
# under the ruleset; a landing before every stone is v1.  Stone history must
# itself be append-only (no deletion, modification or move, judged with
# renames disabled, on main and on every candidate edge), and inside every
# gate run the label this process applies, the tuples its classifier uses and
# the latest stone in the candidate tree must agree (``live_surface_findings``),
# so a copy that widens any of them without laying its stone cannot run green.
# Each stone records a digest of its version's tuples, so the registered entry
# cannot be widened in place either — jointly rebinding the entry and the
# aliases disagrees with the ledger.  What no self-inspection can cover is a
# copy that rewrites the verifier itself; that is what the review of a
